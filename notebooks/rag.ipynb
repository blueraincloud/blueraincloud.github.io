      "TLPT is a threat-led penetration testing method that involves simulating cyber attacks on live production systems to identify vulnerabilities. It is designed to be more advanced than less sophisticated testing methods covered by Article 24 of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Requirements and Differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Live Production Systems:** TLPT must be carried out on live production systems, as per Articles 3(17) and 26(2) of DORA.\n",
      "2. **Advanced Testing Methodology:** TLPT is a more advanced testing method than less sophisticated testing methods covered by Article 24 of DORA.\n",
      "3. **Risk Management:** The control team must conduct an assessment of risks associated with the testing, including potential impacts on the financial entity (Article 5).\n",
      "4. **Participants and Stakeholders:** A TLPT involves five types of participants, including a TLPT cyber team (similar to the TIBER-EU framework), a control team, testers, threat intelligence providers, and ICT third-party service providers.\n",
      "5. **Secrecy Arrangements:** Secrecy arrangements must be in place for staff within the financial entity, testers, and threat intelligence providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The main differences between TLPT and other testing methods are its advanced nature, requirement to test live production systems, and the need for risk management assessments. Additionally, TLPT involves a more complex set of participants and stakeholders compared to less sophisticated testing methods.\n"
